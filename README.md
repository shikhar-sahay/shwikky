Shwikky is a Swiggy-style food delivery app built **entirely through AI prompts and vibe coding**. No manual code, no human scaffolding, just pure AI-driven creation.

## How Shwikky Was Born

It all started with a late-night Discord debate and a $20 bet: could I build a real app using only AI? Armed with **v0 for AI-powered code generation** and **ChatGPT for debugging, prompting, and guidance**, I dove into the challenge.

The result? A functional, fully vibe-coded prototype with a landing page, restaurant pages, cart & checkout, and user authentication, all generated through AI prompts.

This story is documented in my blog:
